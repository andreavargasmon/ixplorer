# ixplorer gadgets

ixplorer gadgets are a way to create and check your project tickets without 
leaving RStudio and more important: without interrupting your workflow.

# How to use the ixplorer gadgets

First you have to install the ixplorer package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ixpantia/gitear")
```

When you are done with the installation, you will see three options under the
IXPLORER header, in the *Addins* menu:

 - Authenticate
 - Create ticket
 - Current tickets
 - ixplorer dashboard

## Authenticate gadget

This is the first step in order to be able to create tickets or check you project
tickets with the ixplorer gadgets. You will need an API key (provided by your
project  manager).

![](img/authentication_gadget.png)

At the **ixplorer url** make sure to include the internet address of your
ixplorer repository. It will be similar to: `https://ixplorer_name.ixpantia.com/`

The next step is to fill the name of the **upstream project**. This is the
project where the source version of the repository resides. From this source
you, and other members of your team, will have *forked* your own clone of this
repository to make changes and propose pull requests. In our workflow we manage
all the tickets centrally in the **upstream project**. Any tickets that you
create in your personal fork will not be visible through the ixplorer gadget
(and in general we recommend not to work with personal tickets).

At the **ixplorer repository name** please write the name of the specific
repository where we are going to work with in the current RStudio project that
is active. 

Finally you have to speficy your user name in the section **ixplorer user name**
This is the same user name that we use to access to the ixplorer environment.

There is an **persist token** option. If you are working in your personal
computer, you can select this option. It will keep a copy of all your
authentication data in a local file to reuse it the next time you open the
project in RStudio. Otherwise you will have to authenticate each
time that you are going to work on the same project.

Be careful because if you are working in somebody else's computer, your
personal authentication data is going to be stored on that machine. If you
are going to work on a shared or public computer, it it best to leave the 
**persist token** option without a checkmark.

#### How the .ixplorer looks like?

At the end of your authentication through yout authentication gadget, a 
resulting ixplorer file with your credentials will look like this:

IXTOKEN= 08864824783ec0b589101191f65e643e54c8ad76c
IXURL= https://ixplorer_name.ixpantia.com/
IXPROJECT= your_project_name
IXREPO= your_repo_name
IXUSER= your_user_name

Every time you use the other gadgets, they are going to check this .ixplorer
file and make this credentials part of your session environment variables.

If you use the function `Sys.getenv()` you are going to be able to see this
credentials with the IX names on it.

## Create ticket gadget

At this point you should have all your authentication process done. If that is 
correct you will to be able to create a ticket without getting out of RStudio!

If everything is okay, you are just going to see the **ticket title** and
**Description** section. If not, you are going to see a text warning you what
is missing.

In this gadget you can create a ticket without loosing your workflow and ideas.
If you came up  with a new ticket (wish/improvement/question) you can go to
Addins > Create ticket and under the **ticket title** write the title of your
new ticket and under the **Description** section write your idea. 

This ticket is going to appear on your ixplorer repository open tickets

## Current tickets

This gadget is designed to give you a quick overview of active tickets and
their status. Also you will find some quick links that will take you to the 
ixplorer if you want to check details such as ticket comments or make changes 
like due dates of assignments.

At the first tab **My tickets**, you are going to be able to check the tickets
assigned to you with the number id that also is a quick link to the ticket on
your ixplorer environment. Also you will see a column with the number of days 
left (on green) or days passed the due date (red).

![](img/my_tickets.png)

On the second tab **Team tickets** you will see all open tickets related to the
current (active) project, not just the ones assigned to you. The ID number is a
quick link to the complete ticket on your ixplorer and the Due column is the
days left on green for the due date or red if the due date was missed.

Finally the **Quick links** you have the links to the principal components
of your project repository, so you don't have to type to much in your browser to
find a specific direction.

This quick links will allow you to find faster specific details of your project
repository as closed tickets, milestones, the wiki, or the project place where
all the repositories concerning to the project are.
