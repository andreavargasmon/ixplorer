# ixplorer gadgets

ixplorer gadgets are a way to create and review tickets for your project 
without having to exit RStudio and more importantly: without having to
interrupt your workflow.

# How to use the ixplorer gadgets?

Fistly, we need to install the ixplorer package

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ixpantia/gitear")
```


When we are ready with the installation we can see three options in the
*Addins* menu under the IXPLORER header

- Authentication
- Create tickets
- Current tickets

## Authentication gadget

This is the first step to be able to generate tickets or review them within your
repository for a given project. You will need an API token. (which will be
provided by your project management.)

In the **ixplorer URL** segment you need to make sure to include the
internet address of your ixplorer repository. should be similar
to `https://ixplorer_name.ixpantia.com`

The next step is to fill in the name of the **upstream project**. This is the
project where the source version of your repository resides. From this source,
you and other team members will have forked and cloned the repository
to generate changes and propose them as merge requests. in the flow of
job, all tickets are handled centrally in the project
**upstream**. Any ticket that is generated on your personal fork, does not
will be displayed through the ixplorer gadget (and in general we do not recommend
work with personal tickets)

In the **ixplorer repository name** segment please type the
name of the specific repository on which you want to work in the
active session of the RStudio project.

Finally you have to specify your username in the section
**ixplorer username**. It is the same username that is used
to access your ixplorer environment.

Additionally, the authentication gadget has an optional space for
to choose your preferred language. Later gadgets will be displayed
always in the language of your choice.

Once the "done" or "done" button is pressed you may be prompted to
set a password. This password may be required the next time you
start a new session and want to get information about this instance, for
example your open tickets. Therefore it is important to store this password
in a safe place, preferably an appropriate password manager.

If you have previously saved your credentials for any instance
you can go directly to the "ixploring" or "ixplorando" tab in
the gadget. Here you will be given the option to choose the instance in which
you want to work, then the option to choose between the projects of that instance
and finally the repositories.

Be careful in this step if you are working on the computer
of someone else, since your authentication data will be stored in that
computer. So if you are going to work on someone else's computer or on
a shared computer, it is best to use the function delete_credentials() at the end of
your working session to delete your computer credentials completely.

## Create tickets gadget

At this point you should have completed the authentication process. Yes this
is correct you will be able to create a ticket without having to exit RStudio!

If everything is correct, you will see the **ticket title** section and
**Description**. If not, you will see a warning text mentioning what
it is missing. This gadget works on the last instance that you have
saved in the authentication gadget. A message such as "you are
currently on test instance" appears on your console so you can
make sure you are creating the ticket in the proper repository. this window
will appear in the language you have saved in the authentication gadget

In the second tab **Team ticket** you can review all tickets
open files related to the current project and assigned to all members of the
team minus you. The identification number is a link to the information
of the ticket in the ixplorer environment and the "deadline" column is
how many days are left (in green) or how many days have been exceeded (in red) with
regarding the deadline.

Finally the **Quick Links** tab has the links to the components
main files of the project repository, so you don't have to write much in
your web browser to find a specific address.

These links will allow you to more quickly find details
specific to your project repository such as closed tickets, milestones, the
wiki or the project site where other relevant repositories are located.

# Other usefull functions

Apart from the gadgets, ixplorer offers the following functions to obtain
information from the console.

* **list_open_tickets()**: Returns a tibble with its open tickets.
It uses, by default, the last instance you saved in the authentication gadget.
However, you can specify the desired instance using the "instance" variable within the function. You can also specify the number of days
backwards from where you want to get the tickets.

* **list_closed_tickets()**: Returns a tibble with its closed tickets.
It uses, by default, the last instance you saved in the authentication gadget.
However, you can specify the desired instance using the "instance" variable within the function. You can also specify the number of days
backwards from where you want to get the tickets.

* **list_open_pr()**: Returns a tibble with your open merge requests.
This function searches all your saved default ixplorer instances for merge requests assigned to you. However, both the instance
as the assigned person can be specified.

# Making version control easier

The following functions are intendet to make your git version control
easier

* **synch_branch()**: Allows you to update your master branch from your upstream
automatically by a rebase. It does the steps we usually use,
fetch upstream, checkout master, rebase upstream/master, and push.

* **add_upstream()**: Allows you to include your upstream directly from your
active repository in Rstudio. By default it takes the information from the last
instance saved in

* **set_git_timeout()**: Allows you to specify the time you want to save your
git credentials on your remote server. The default is 4 hours. The
function takes its time in seconds.
