## Dictionary purpose

The aim of this dictionary is to provide you with short explanations about the
main components of the ixplorer. This will help you with your everyday project
workflow and communicate better with you Data Science team.

## What is a project?

A project is your work subject where you try to reach specific goals. Within a 
project you can have several repositories up to your needs of organization. 

A project can be for example a credit risk modelling and under this project you
can have the exploratory_analysis repo, the model repository and the R package
repository to keep code separated but code that it's referred to the same topic.

The page of a project would like similar to this one:

## What is a repository?

A repository can be viewed as a folder where you keep all your files. This files
can be share with other team members to start to collaborate on differente tickets.

There are ways to keep an organized repository either if you are working in a
R package or in a single RStudio project with  R files or others.

Our recommendation is:

- To have a data folder inside your repository where you can put all different
sources of data
- image folder if you need to include images or binaries files.
- The .Rproject should be visible
- The R scripts shouldnot be in a folder and names should be without spaces,
points or combining lower/upper cases.

## What is upstream?

Upstream is the standard name that we use to refer to the "central" repository
which is the one that have the functional clean code. From this central repository
everyone in the team have to make a fork from in order to work on their tickets.

## Fork

This is a "copy" of the central repository. It's going to be under your user 
name. You fork a repository when you want to contribute with code to the
central repository. At  the moment when you are ready to offer your improvements, 
you do a pull request. In your fork (unless you do a pull request) only your
work is going to affect your forked repository, not the original one.
You have to be aware that all the changes made in the upstream repository
are not going to appear automatically in your fork unless you follow a process
with git to update your project.

## Ticket

Tickets are made for document things that need to be donde inside a repository.
Tickets can have differente categories:

 - Question: a question related to the topics of the repository.
 - New: a new feature that can be achieve in the code.
 - Improve: an idea or remark of an improvement that can be done.
 - Error: when something in the code it's not working and needs to be resolve.
 - Wish: a feature that can be done but it have no priority.
 
## Milestone

A way to organize your project priorities, assigning tikects to each of the 
milestone that you define. An example of a milestone can be a release of a package.

## Wiki

The place of your repository where you can document, define and keep information
needed to communicate to your team to solve doubts, to get informed about the
project.

## Release

Release is made to establish a release of your code, or what it means: that you
have a due date where all the code it's ready so it has a review, clean and 
functional code. 

All this code that can be an R package is labeled as a release so it marks an
specific point on your git project history.

## Configuration

On this place you can configure your repository, people who have access, who
can collaborate, write or change code. If you want to eliminate your repository,
change the rights this is the place to go.
